# Web atelier project of Gualandris Andrea.

# FriendsMeet

This web application allows users to organise events and participate in those organised by others. 
A user can create their own account that they will use to log in. A user can create an event of any category that will be visible to all. Once the event has been created, it will be possible to delete and edit it. Other users can add to the event until the maximum number of participants has been reached.
Within the myevents page, it is possible to see the events that have been created by the logged-in user and those to which they have been added.
Within the search page, it is possible to search for events by category and location.
From each page where you see events, you can enter the event page and click on it to see detailed information, join buttons
disjoin and the edit and delete buttons if you are logged in as the event creator. 
On the featured page, you can see the events in reverse chronological order.
